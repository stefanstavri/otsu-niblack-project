# otsu-niblack-project

This is a one semester project that helped me better understand what image processing is all about. During the documentation phase, I learned about image binarization, thresholding and
how both Otsu and Niblack algorithms work.

## Usage

Run

```bash
 # To make the file executable
 chmod +x run-project.sh 

 ./run-project.sh
```

If every implemented algorithm worked just fine, you will see this message in the terminal:
```bash
Algoritm <ALGO_NAME> aplicat              OK
```
Then, a *Figure 1* should pop up showing you all the processed images.
